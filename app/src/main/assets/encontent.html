	<u>Coordination tag</u>
	<p>The easiest way to agree remotly about who should draw next is
		by making a little stripe in a corner to warn that you start drawing
		and erasing it when you pass the turn. The other person does the same
		using another color</p>
	<b>Invite to draw</b>
	<br>

	<p>The funniest feature about QD is that it enables
		you to share your drawings with another person.</p>
	<p>Given that all Android devices are linked to a GMAIL account and
		that all incoming emails trigger a sound signal, QD is based on GMAIL
		to function.</p>
	<p>So, if you want to invite another person to draw’n chat, you
		just have to follow the following steps:</p>

	<OL>
		<li>Choose "Invite" in your QD menu.</li>
		<li>Choose your contact (he must have a GMAIL account
			synchronized in his phone/tablet).</li>
		<li>QD will send your contact an email. Your connection indicator
			becomes yellow and from there on all you draw in your device will be
			shared with the other device when it joins the session.</li>
		<li>When the other person receives the invitation email, he just
			needs to click on the link included, choose QD to open it and join
			the session (your connection indicator becomes green).</li>
		<li>You can leave the session whenever you want just by clicking
			on the "unshare" button at the QD menu (your connection indicator
			becomes gray).</li>
